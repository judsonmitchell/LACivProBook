Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth.  The  matter is admitted unless, within thirty days after service of the request, or within such  shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed  serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to  the matter, signed by the party or by his attorney.  The written answer or reasons for  objection to each request for admission shall immediately follow a restatement of the request  for admission to which the answer or objection is responding.  If objection is made, the  reasons therefor shall be stated.  The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in  detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter.  A  denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith  requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an  admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the  remainder.  An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason  for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the  information known or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or  deny.  A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested  presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may,  subject to the provisions of Article 1472, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot  admit or deny it.<\/span><\/span><\/p>  <p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<\/span>B.

Unless the court determines that an objection is  justified, it shall order that an answer be served.  If the court determines that an answer does  not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted  or that an amended answer be served.  The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that  final disposition of the request be made at a pretrial conference or at a designated time prior  to trial.

contained in the Code of Civil Procedure:<\/p>  <p>(1)(a) &nbsp;If the foreign corporation or the foreign limited liability company is not one required by law to appoint an agent for the service of process, but has engaged in a business activity in this state, service of process in an action or proceeding on a cause of action resulting from such business activity in this state, or for any taxes due or other obligations arising therefrom, may be made on any employee or agent of the corporation or limited liability company of suitable age and discretion found in the state.<\/p>  <p>(b) &nbsp;If such employees or agents are no longer in the state, or cannot be found after diligent effort, the officer charged with the duty of making the service shall make his return to the court, stating the efforts made by him to secure service and the reason why he was unable to do so. &nbsp;Thereupon the court shall order that service shall be made on the secretary of state, or on some other individual in his office whom the secretary of state may designate to receive service of process.<\/p>  <p>(c) &nbsp;The secretary of state shall ascertain the domiciliary post office address of the corporation, or limited liability company and shall send the original papers served to the corporation or limited liability company by registered or certified mail, or by commercial courier as defined in R.S. 13:3204(D), when the corporation or person to be served is located outside of this state. &nbsp;The secretary of state shall retain in his office true copies of these papers, on which he shall note the date, the manner and other particulars of the service, and of the disposition made of the original papers.<\/p>  <p>(2) &nbsp;In an action or proceeding brought in a parish other than that of the domicile of a defendant, citation and all other legal process may be served on this defendant in the parish where the action or proceeding was brought, if the defendant can be served therein. &nbsp;Otherwise, the process may be sent by the clerk of the court from which it issued to any parish where the defendant may be found, and service may be made by the sheriff or a constable of the latter parish.<\/p>  <p>(3) &nbsp;When an action or proceeding is brought in the parish of the domicile of a defendant, and the latter is absent therefrom, service may be made on him in any parish of the state where he may be found.<\/p>  <p>(4) &nbsp;An acceptance of service shall be dated, and if no date is shown thereon, the acceptance takes effect from the date of its filing in court. &nbsp;No acceptance of service shall affect the delays allowed by law or by the local rules of court.<\/p>  <p>(5) &nbsp;The return of the serving officer on any citation or other legal process is conclusive, unless directly attacked. &nbsp;Such an attack may be made by rule in the action or proceeding, if made prior to judgment. &nbsp;If made after judgment, the return may be attacked only in a direct action to annul the judgment, which may be brought in the original action or proceeding.<\/p>  <p>If the defendant was actually served, the court may correct an error in the return by an amendment thereof, on a rule brought against and tried contradictorily with the defendant who was served, or any other party who may be affected by the amendment.<\/p>  <p>(6) &nbsp;Service of process on an inmate of a public institution may be made by the sheriff or any constable of the parish where the institution is situated.<\/p>  <p>(7) &nbsp;Service of process by a sheriff or constable shall be returned into the court which issued the process as soon as possible after the service is made. &nbsp;In addition thereto, the serving officer shall keep a complete record thereof in a book

regardless of the number of suits filed or claims made for the wrongful death of that person.<\/p>  <p>(3)(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;In any suit for personal injury against a political subdivision wherein the

services.<\/p>  <p>(2) &nbsp;&quot;Loss of earnings&quot; and &quot;loss of support&quot; for the purpose of this Section means any form of economic loss already sustained by the claimant as a result of the injury or wrongful death which forms the basis of the claim. &nbsp;&quot;Loss of future earnings&quot; and &quot;loss of future support&quot; means any form of economic loss which the claimant will sustain after the trial as a result of the injury or death which forms the basis of the claim.<\/p>  <p>(3) &nbsp;&quot;Reversionary trust&quot; means a trust established by a political subdivision for the exclusive benefit of the claimant to pay the medical care and related benefits as they accrue, including without limitation reasonable and necessary amounts for all diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease or condition from which the injured person suffers as a result of the injuries, and the sequelae thereof, sustained by the claimant on the date the injury
